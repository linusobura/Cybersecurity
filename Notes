# Cyberseurity Tools
- [DeepSound (https://github.com/Jpinsoft/DeepSound)] - DeepSound is a steganography tool and audio converter that hides secret data into audio files. The application also enables you to extract secret files directly from audio files or audio CD tracks.
- [Hstego (https://github.com/daniellerch/hstego)] - HStego is a tool for hiding data in bitmap and JPEG images. This tool uses some of the most advanced steganography methods known today, along with an upper limit on the amount of data that can be hidden so that it cannot be reliably detected by modern steganography tools.
